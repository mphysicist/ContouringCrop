# ContouringCrop
The script was developed using Varian's research box (T-BOX), ESAPI v15.5, Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019, and Varian's TPS. We employed Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) technology to provide users with a GUI for selecting desired structures. The main ESAPI script was written in C# code. The development and testing of the script were conducted on the T-BOX with Visual Studio, and its implementation in the planning workflow was subsequently performed on the TPS. Script significantly reduced the cropping time to just a few seconds. It eliminated the risk of errors such as cropping or overwriting other structures. By selecting all the structures, the script automatically cropped only the overlapping regions, eliminating the need for manual identification. The streamlined workflow was achieved through a single GUI window, ensuring a smooth and error-free process. It is a binary plugin project.
